Difficulty: Average
Yield: 48 cookies
INGREDIENTS:
9 ounces of unsalted butter,
room temperature 6 ounces of light brown sugar,
6 ounces of granulated sugar,
2 eggs,
1 teaspoon vanilla extract,
13 ounces bread flour,
1 teaspoon salt,
1 teaspoon baking soda,
12 ounces of semisweet chocolate chips,
Step 1: Cream the butter & Sugar,
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together, using the dough hook at medium speed. And the eggs and vanilla.
Step 2: Add dry ingredients
Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt together; mix into the batter. Stir in the chocolate chips (and walnuts, if desired). Dough should easily come together and form a ball.
Step 3: Divide the dough
Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces, approximately 1 pound each. Roll each piece into a rope 16 inches long and cut each rope into 16 equal pieces.
Step 4: Get ready to bake
Place the pieces, cut side up (you do not need to roll the pieces round), on sheet pans lined with parchment paper. Stagger the cookies so they do not bake together. These cookies end up being 2 Â½-3inches in diameter.
Step 5: The finish line
Bake the cookies until just done, about 10 minutes. The cookies should still be a bit sticky in the middle and just slightly brown at the edges. In my experience, if you let the tops get too brown, you are going to have a very crunchy cooky once they cool! If that is your jam, so be it, but consider yourself warned.

I like to move the cookies to a cooling rack after a few minutes, to completely cool. Then, you can store them in an airtight container for a few days (if you have any left).

Enjoy your cookies! The Foodie CHIP!
